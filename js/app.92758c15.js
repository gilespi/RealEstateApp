Even if you just buy some weights, a yoga mat, and other inexpensive equipment, you can turn your unused room into something useful.","content2":"Playroom: If youâre tired of tripping over your kidsâ toys in your nice, fancy living room, turn that extra room into their own space.

You want your home to stand out from the others, and the exterior will be the first area buyers see. If itâs not in top shape, thereâs a good chance buyers will move on to the next home. So make sure youâre trimming the lawn, washing the siding and shining everything else up in preparation for showings. Here are some essential areas to address:","content2":"Your siding probably looks a bit dirty and dusty after this last winter, so itâs time to wash it off and make it look shiny and new for the spring. Use soapy water and a bristled brush to remove dirt and debris. If the grime and dirt wonât come off easily, you may need to use a pressure washer or power washer to remove it. You can rent a pressure washer from a local home improvement store or hire a professional power washer. The cost for exterior power washing ranges from $200 to $400, depending on the time and square footage involved. You should also take this time to wash your garage door, as it will be one of the first things buyers see. Do not use a power washer to clean your windows and doors though, because it could damage them and lead to repair costs.","content3":"","image":"https://www.century21.com/real-estate-blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/blog.jpg","tags":["home buying","home improvement","investing"],"category":"Home Buying","share":"5","like":"3","comments":[{"user":"Jane Smith","comment":"Great tips!

Instead of taking out loans for an expensive remodel, consider investing in a few of these less expensive remodeling alternatives:","content2":"If you have a porcelain bathtub that looks a bit worn, the alternative to replacing it is refinishing the tub. While refinishing is a long process, it costs less than a new bathtub, about $300 to $1,000 according to ImproveNet. The process involves getting off all of the dirt and grime and then sanding it before putting on new layers of paint and primer. Itâs a process that will leave your bathtub looking almost new if you have the right tools and want to invest at least a day working to refinish it.","content3":"Over time wood floors get scuffed, scratched and worn down by foot traffic in kitchens, living rooms and hallways. While homeowners might consider replacing parts or the whole wood floor, another option is to refinish the wood. The DIY approach is to sand down the wood floor and then re-stain it, which requires a lot of elbow grease and time to complete. If you want to have a flooring professional do the work, you might pay between $1,500 and $2,000 for wood floor refinishing depending on the square footage.","image":"https://www.century21.com/real-estate-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/493919745.jpg","tags":["home buying","home improvement","investing"],"category":"Home Improvement","share":"5","like":"3","comments":[{"user":"Jane Smith","comment":"Great tips!
